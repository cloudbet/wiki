This document provides an overview of the structure and terminology used in the Cloudbet sportsbook, assisting users in navigating the platform effectively.

## Sport

To begin placing a bet, first select the sport. For example, choose Soccer.

## Category

Categories on Cloudbet typically represent countries but can also include special tournaments. For instance, the "International Clubs" category in Soccer covers competitions like the UEFA Europa League or the AFC Champions League. Unique categorizations exist for some sports like tennis or virtual sports:

- **International Clubs** in Soccer: Competitions such as the UEFA Europa League or the AFC Champions League.
- **Tennis**: Categories include international tournaments like **ATP**, **Challenger**, ITF Men/Women.
- **Virtual**: Virtual sports have their own categories.

## Competition

Within a category, choose a specific competition. Other bookmakers may call this a tournament. For example, in the Germany category, you might select the German Bundesliga.

## Events, Matches, and Outrights, Futures

Within a competition, you will find a list of matches, typically divided into three subcategories:

- **Event**: An individual game, e.g., Bayer Leverkusen vs. FC Augsburg.
- **Outright**: Bets on the overall outcome of a league, tournament, or competition. This includes bets on the top scorer, championship winner, or political outcomes.
- **Multi-runner Event**: Events with multiple participants, such as horse races, golf tournaments, or esports. Bets can be placed on winners, top finishers, head-to-head outcomes, or specific order of finish.

## Markets, Lines, and Selections

After selecting a competition and event, choose from various markets to place your bet.

### Market

Markets describe different types of bets available for an event. Examples include:

- **Full Time Result**
- **Asian Handicap**
- **Total Goals**
- **Both Teams To Score**
- **Alternative Lines for Asian Handicap and Total Goals**

### Lines

Lines refer to specific conditions set by the bookmaker for a given market, such as the odds for different outcomes in a "Full Time Result" market or total goals in a match.

### Selection

Selections are specific outcomes within a market. For instance, in a Full Time Result market for a game between Germany and Scotland, selections might be:

- Germany - 1.27
- Draw - 5.90
- Scotland - 11.1

The odds indicate the potential return if the bet wins. For example, a $100 bet on Scotland at 11.1 odds would return $1110 if Scotland wins, including the original stake.

## Markets Examples

### Asian Handicap

Asian Handicap betting levels the playing field by giving the underdog a head start or the favorite a deficit, eliminating the possibility of a draw and offering only two outcomes.

- **Whole Number Handicaps**: Team A -1 means Team A must win by more than 1 goal to win the bet. If they win by exactly 1 goal, the bet is a push (stake refunded).
- **Quarter Number Handicaps**: Splits the bet into two separate bets, such as Team A -0.25, acting as two bets on 0 and -0.5. The combined outcomes determine the overall result.

### Double Chance

Double Chance markets allow bettors to cover two of the three possible outcomes in a match, reducing risk but generally offering lower odds:

- **Team A or Draw (1X)**
- **Team A or Team B (12)**
- **Draw or Team B (X2)**

### Outright, Futures Bets

Outrights are wagers placed on overall outcomes, such as the winner of a league or tournament. These bets are often made early in the competition and settled at its conclusion.

### Multi-Runner Events

These events involve multiple participants, such as horse races or golf tournaments. Bet types include:

- **Win Bets**: Betting on the event winner.
- **Place Bets**: Betting on a competitor to finish in a top position.
- **Head-to-head Bets**: Betting on which of two competitors will finish higher.
- **Forecast/Tricast Bets**: Betting on the exact order of finish for the top two/three places.
