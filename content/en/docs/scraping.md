Cloudbet supports scraping activities under specific conditions and does not deploy Cloudflare captcha pages by default, regardless of the IP origin, including datacenter IPs. Captcha challenges are only activated when dynamic rate limits are exceeded. These limits are regularly reviewed and adjusted to minimize disruptions and maintain a seamless user experience.
