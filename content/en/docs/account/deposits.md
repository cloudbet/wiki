When making cryptocurrency deposits on Cloudbet, it's useful to understand the terminology and processes to ensure smooth and secure transactions.

Start by choosing the currency you wish to deposit from the available list (e.g., USDT). Next, select the appropriate network, such as Ethereum, to match the currency. You will receive a deposit address specific to your choices. Use the provided address or QR code in your wallet to send the assets. Ensure that the network in your wallet matches the network of the deposit address. Your funds will be credited to your Cloudbet account as soon as the transaction is verified.

### Currency

A "currency" is the cryptocurrency or token you are transacting, such as BTC, USDT, ETH, and others. Each asset can exist on multiple networks, and choosing the correct network is a requirement for successful transactions.

### Network

The "network" denotes the blockchain network used for your transactions. Popular networks include Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, and TRON, each with unique characteristics and supported assets.

### Deposit Address

The "deposit address" is the specific address on a blockchain network where transactions are directed. Each network and asset type has a distinct address, and using the correct one ensures your funds reach their intended destination.

## Common Mishaps and How to Avoid Them

### Sending Assets to the Wrong Network

One of the most common errors is sending assets to an address on the wrong network. For example, sending USDT (ERC-20) to a BNB Smart Chain address can result in lost funds. Always double-check the network selected in your wallet before confirming the transaction.

### Unsupported Network or Address

Sending assets to a network not supported by the receiving wallet or platform is another frequent issue. If you send tokens to a network the wallet does not recognize, the transaction might complete, but the funds will be irrecoverable. Ensure that the receiving platform supports the network for the selected asset.

### Wrong Address Format

Using an incorrect address format for the selected network can lead to lost funds. For instance, sending Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which operates on the Ethereum network, to a native Bitcoin (BTC) address is a mistake with irreversible consequences. Despite similar address styles between BTC and WBTC, they are fundamentally incompatible for direct transfers. For example, any Ethereum-based asset sent to an address like `0x3aD7NdddXXjsbYh8bC4xjnpUXqqdXHKSHy`, mistaken for a Bitcoin P2SH address  `3aD7NdddXXjsbYh8bC4xjnpUXqqdXHKSHy`, will result in the irretrievable loss of tokens.

### Human Error

Errors such as copying and pasting incorrect addresses or selecting the wrong options can lead to the irreversible loss of funds. To prevent this, always double-check all transaction details before confirming.
